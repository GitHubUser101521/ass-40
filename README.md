<h3>Animation Sequence</h3>

There are 2 different timelines - The squares & A Loading Indicator

<b>The Squares</b>
- The blue sq will animate to the right by 100 pixels along the x-axis.
- Two seconds after the previous animation, the green sq will animate to the right by 100 pixels along the x-axis.
- The blue sq will then animate downwards by 100 pixels along the y-axis.
- The green sq will move right, reaching an x-axis position of 180 pixels.
- The blue sq will move downwards along the y-axis, 200 pixels below its initial y position.
- The blue sq will then move to the left, reaching an x-axis position of -250 pixels to its initial x position.
- The blue sq will then move back to its original vertical position (y-0).
- The red sq will animate to the right by 80 pixels along the x-axis.
- The blue sq will move to the right slightly from its previous position, reaching an x-axis position of -175 pixels relative to its initial x position.
- Finally, the green sq will move back to an x-axis position of 100 pixels.

<b>Loading Indicator</b>
- Each little indicators will be at its default y position.
- Then they will move upwards by 20 pixels.
- After moving up, it will go back to its default position.
- This up-and-down movement will repeat forever and the start of the upward animation for each loading-indicator will be staggered by 0.1 seconds, creating a wave-like motion.
